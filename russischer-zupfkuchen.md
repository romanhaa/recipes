## Ingredients

- Dough:
  - Flour (type 405): 300 g
  - Cocoa powder: 4-5 tbsp.
  - Sugar: 150 g
  - Baking powder: 1 bag
  - Eggs: 1 (medium)
  - Butter: 150 g (cold)
  - Salt: 1 pinch
- Filling:
  - Eggs: 3 (medium)
  - Sugar: 150 g
  - Butter: 200 g (soft)
  - Magerquark: 500 g
  - Vanilla sugar: 1 bag
  - Vanilla pudding powder: 1 bag

## Steps

- Heat oven to 180°C (static) or 160°C (fan)
- Grease a 26 cm springform pan well
- For the dough, knead together: flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, egg, butter, salt
into a smooth, even dough
- Press half of the dough into the springform pan
- Form a rim about 3 cm high
- Set aside the remaining dough
- Run a knife along the rim of the dough
- Trim off any excess or uneven parts to make the edge smooth and even
- Whisk together the eggs, sugar, and butter
- Add the low-fat quark, vanilla sugar, and vanilla pudding powder
- Mix well until smooth
- Pour the mixture onto the prepared dough base
- Tear the remaining dough into small pieces
- Place the pieces carefully on top of the filling, leaving small gaps between them
- Bake in the preheated oven for about 60 minutes
- Optionally, cover with aluminum foil after 45 minutes to prevent over-browning
- Check the cake: it should be slightly set — no longer very wobbly, but not completely firm
- Let it cool completely before removing it from the pan
- Optionally dust with powdered sugar
- Cut into approximately 12 pieces
