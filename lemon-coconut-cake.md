# Lemon coconut cake

## Ingredients

- Preparation
  - Butter to grease loaf pan
- Cake
  - 200g butter, chopped, at room temperature
  - 215g caster sugar
  - 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon rind
  - 2 eggs
  - 65g flaked coconut
  - 300g self-raising flour
  - 125ml fresh lemon juice
  - 60ml milk
- Icing
  - 150g icing sugar mixture, sifted
  - 1.5 tablespoon hot water
  - 0.5 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
  - 30g flaked coconut

## Steps

1) Preheat oven to 170Â°C. Grease an 11x21 cm (base measurement) loaf pan with butter.
2) Use an electric beater to beat the butter, sugar, and lemon rind until pale and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
3) Stir the desiccated coconut into the egg mixture. Fold in the flour, lemon juice and milk, in alternating batches, until just combined. Spoon mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface.
4) Bake cake in oven for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Set aside in pan for 5 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely.
5) Combine the icing sugar, water and vanilla in a bowl. Drizzle over the cake and sprinkle with flaked coconut. Serve.
