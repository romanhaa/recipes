# Pastéis de Nata

## Ingredients

For the puff pastry:

- 350 g of low protein flour
- 180 g of cold water
- 6 gr of fine salt
- 250 g of a square of butter proper for puff pastry

For the custard:

- 300 ml of whole milk
- 200 ml of cream (35% fat content)
- 180 g of caster sugar
- 2 tablespoon of cornstarch
- 4 egg yolks
- cinnamon stick
- lemon zest

## Steps

Puff pastry:

1. In a large bowl combine the flour, water and salt until you get a proper dough.
2. Change for a working surface and knead for 3 minutes. Wrap in cling film and let it rest in the fridge for 10 minutes
3. With a rolling pin extend the dough creating 4 wings with a lump in the middle. The wings should have size to cover the square of butter.
4. Place the butter in the center of the dough, close with the wings and press.
5. With a rolling pin extend the dough until you get a rectangle that's about 5 mm thick.
6. Fold in the pastry in three parts.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 one time
8. For the final fold divide the dough in 4 parts instead of 3.
9. Sprinkle the surface of the dough with water. Roll and press a bit to form a roll. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
10. Cut 8 mm thick slices of puff pastry.
11. Place a disc of dough on the bottom of the tins and with your thumbs press and stretch the dough until it completely covers the tin interior.

Custard:

1. Dissolve the cornstarch with a part of milk.
2. In a pot, combine everything, except the egg yolks. Bring to a low simmering just to infuse the aromatics and thicken it up to a double cream texture (6 minutes)
3. Let it cool to room temperature before adding the beating egg yolks.
4. Fill up the tins up to ¾.
5. Bake at maximum heat (250ºC). Place the tray in the middle of the oven, fan off with heat coming from top and bottom.
6. Should bake for 12/15 minutes. First, the puff pastry will start to flake. After a few minutes the custard will rise and form a dome. When the black dots appear on top, Pastéis de Nata are done.

## Notes

- With the ingredients listed above I get enough dough for 24 pasteis. I typically only make 12 pasteis in a 3x4 muffin tray and freeze the rest of the dough for another time.
- To get the right amount of custard for 12 pasteis, I multiply the ingredients for the custard by 3/4, i.e. 225 ml of milk, 150 ml of cream, etc.
